I developed a time tracking dashboard. The idea of this project was to try out the css grid because, before now I either made use of bootstrap or flexbox. I used javascript to ensure that on click of the preferred time i.e, daily, weekly or monthly, information perculiar to that time showed up. 
I would like to appreciate frontend mentor for providing the files used in this project. I took into cognizance the responisveness of the webpage in different screen sizes even though the challenge just considered two screen sizes. The link to the challenge can be found below
